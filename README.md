# Usage
<h2>With a standard editor</h2>
In your photo editor (Photoshop, etc.) create guides at the point for the flare center to be. Check the document's dimensions, as well as the X and Y where the guides intersect. Go to <a href="https://yikuansun.github.io/sci-fi-flares/">https://yikuansun.github.io/sci-fi-flares/</a> and edit the information on the right, or choose a preset. If you would like to share a preset, please use a pull request.
<h2>As a Photopea plugin</h2>

Open the plugin using the F icon on the menu on the right. On your Photopea document, use guides to find out the X and Y position where the flare needs to be. Edit the boxes in the plugin; when the preview is statisfying, press "add to document." A new document will be opened; close the popup using the same F icon, then drag the layer in the new document into the previous document.
