# sci-fi-flares
Sci-fi lens flare generator

# Usage
In your photo editor (Photoshop, <a href="https://photopea.com">Photopea</a>, etc.) create guides at the point for the flare center to be. Check the document's dimensions, as well as the X and Y where the guides intersect. Go to <a href="https://scififlares.netlify.app">scififlares.netlify.app</a> and do stuff ig.

# Example
Document dimensions: 3840 * 2160<br />
Hotspot style: 1<br />
Streak style: 1<br />
Iris style: 1<br />
Halo style: 1<br />
X position: 1600<br />
Y position: 800<br />

# Issues (for development)
Right now there could be more flare components and better positions for the irises.<br />
The Photopea build is currently not functional.
