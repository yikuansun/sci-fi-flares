Sci-fi lens flare generator

# Usage
In your photo editor (Photoshop, <a href="https://photopea.com">Photopea</a>, etc.) create guides at the point for the flare center to be. Check the document's dimensions, as well as the X and Y where the guides intersect. Go to <a href="https://scififlares.netlify.app">scififlares.netlify.app</a> and do stuff ig.

# Issues (for development)
Sometimes it takes multiple clicks of the button to render all parts of the flare.<br/>
Also right now there could be more flare components and better positions for the irises.
