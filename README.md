Sci-fi lens flare generator

# Usage
<h2>With a standard editor</h2>
In your photo editor (Photoshop, etc.) create guides at the point for the flare center to be. Check the document's dimensions, as well as the X and Y where the guides intersect. Go to <a href="https://scififlares.netlify.app">scififlares.netlify.app</a> and do stuff ig.
<h2>As a Photopea plugin</h2>
Go to <a href="https://www.photopea.com#%7B%22environment%22:%7B%22plugins%22:%5B%7B%22name%22:%22Sci-Fi%20Flares%20By%20Yikuan%20Sun%22,%22url%22:%22https://scififlares.netlify.app/%22,%22width%22:400,%22height%22:500,%22icon%22:%22https://scififlares.netlify.app/icon.png%22%7D%5D%7D%7D">https://www.photopea.com#%7B%22environment%22:%7B%22plugins%22:%5B%7B%22name%22:%22Sci-Fi%20Flares%20By%20Yikuan%20Sun%22,%22url%22:%22https://scififlares.netlify.app/%22,%22width%22:400,%22height%22:500,%22icon%22:%22https://scififlares.netlify.app/icon.png%22%7D%5D%7D%7D</a>. Open the plugin using the lens flare icon on the menu on the right. On your Photopea document, use guides to find out the X and Y position where the flare needs to be. Edit the boxes in the plugin; when the preview is statisfying, press "add to document." A new document will be opened; drag the layer in the new document into the previous document.

# Issues (for development)
Right now there could be more flare components and better positions for the irises.
